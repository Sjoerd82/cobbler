# If you have multiple network interfaces then you can list the ones

#
# Hosts Allow/Hosts Deny lets you restrict who can connect, and you can
# specifiy it as a per share option as well

# ----------------------- Standalone Server Options ------------------------
#
# Security can be set to user, share(deprecated) or server(deprecated)
#
# Backend to store user information in. New installations should
# use either tdbsam or ldapsam. smbpasswd is available for backwards
# compatibility. tdbsam requires no further configuration.
#
# Backends:
#  - smbpasswd (deprecated)
#  - tdbsam: Users must be added using pdbedit
#  - ldapsam: Users must be added in LDAP.

# Username map contains a mapping between unix and non-unix users.
#
# Encrypted passwords are the default for Windows machines.

        # This boolean parameter controls whether Samba attempts to
        # synchronize the UNIX password with the SMB password when the
        # encrypted SMB password in the smbpasswd file is changed. If this is
        # set to yes the program specified in the passwd program parameter
        # is called AS ROOT - to allow the new UNIX password to be set without
        # access to the old UNIX password (as the SMB password change code has
        # no access to the old password cleartext, only the new).

        # This option controls what to do with unsuccessful authentication
        # attempts. The four settings are:
        #  - Never:        Means user login requests with an invalid
        #                  password are rejected. This is the default.
        #  - Bad User:     Means user logins with an invalid password are
        #                  rejected, unless the username does not exist, in
        #                  which case it is treated as a guest login and
        #                  mapped into the guest account.
        #  - Bad Password: Means user logins with an invalid password are
        #                  treated as a guest login and mapped into the guest
        #                  account. Note that this can cause problems as it
        #                  means that any user incorrectly typing their
        #                  password will be silently logged on as "guest" -
        #                  and will not know the reason they cannot access
        #                  files they think they should - there will have
        #                  been no message given to them that they got
        #                  their password wrong. Helpdesk services will hate
        #                  you if you set the map to guest parameter this
        $                  way :-).

        # specified as "guest ok".

# --------------------------- Logging Options -----------------------------
#
# Log File let you specify where to put logs and how to split them up.
#
# Max Log Size let you specify the max size log files should reach

        # If set to yes then Samba debug messages are logged into the system
        # syslog only, and not to the debug log files. There still will be
        # some logging to log.[sn]mbd even if syslog only is enabled.
        syslog only = no

        # The syslog parameter maps how Samba debug messages are logged onto
        # the system syslog logging levels. Samba debug level zero maps onto
        # syslog LOG_ERR, debug level one maps onto LOG_WARNING, debug level
        # two maps onto LOG_NOTICE, debug level three maps onto LOG_INFO.
        # All higher levels are mapped to LOG_DEBUG.
        syslog = 1

        # logs split per machine
        ;log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m

        max log size = 50

        # Do something sensible when smbd or nmbd crashes
        ; panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d

# ----------------------- Browser Control Options ----------------------------
#
# set local master to no if you don't want Samba to become a master
# browser on your network. Otherwise the normal election rules apply
#
# OS Level determines the precedence of this server in master browser
# elections. The default value should be reasonable
#
# Preferred Master causes Samba to force a local browser election on startup
# and gives it a slightly higher chance of winning the election
;       local master = no
;       os level = 33
;       preferred master = yes

        local master = no
        preferred master = no
        os level = 0

# --------------------------- Printing Options -----------------------------
#
# Load Printers let you load automatically the list of printers rather
# than setting them up individually
#
# Cups Options let you pass the cups libs custom options, setting it to raw
# for example will let you use drivers on your Windows clients
#
# Printcap Name let you specify an alternative printcap file
#
# You can choose a non default printing system using the Printing option

#        # no printing services
#        load printers = no
#        ; cups options = raw

#        ; printcap name = /etc/printcap
#        #obtain list of printers automatically on SystemV
#        ; printcap name = lpstat
#        ; printing = cups

printing = bsd
printcap name = /dev/null

# --------------------------- Filesystem Options ---------------------------
#
# The following options can be uncommented if the filesystem supports
# Extended Attributes and they are enabled (usually by the mount option
# user_xattr). Thess options will let the admin store the DOS attributes
# in an EA and make samba not mess with the permission bits.
#

        # Allow access via symbolic links
        unix extensions = no
        wide links = yes
        follow symlinks = yes

# Note: these options can also be set just per share, setting them in global
# makes them the default for all shares

;       map archive = no
;       map hidden = no
;       map read only = no
;       map system = no
;       store dos attributes = yes

# per machine basis. The %m gets replaced with the netbios name of the
# machine that is connecting.
